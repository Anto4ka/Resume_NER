    "#### Evaluation Metrics for NER\n",
    "Now that we can predict entities using our trained model, we can compare our predictions with the original annotations in our training data to evaluate how well our model performs for our task. The original annotations have been annotated manually by human annotators, and represent a \"Gold Standard\" against which we can compare our predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most classification tasks, the most common evaluation metrics are:\n",
    "* accuracy\n",
    "* precision\n",
    "* recall\n",
    "* f1 score\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand these metrics, we need to understand the following concepts:\n",
    "* True positives - How many of the predicted entities are \"true\" according to the Gold Standard? (training annotation) \n",
    "* True negatives - How many entities did the model not predict which are actually not entities according to the Gold Standard?\n",
    "* False positives - How many entities did the model predict which are NOT entities according to the Gold Standard?  \n",
    "* False negatives - How many entities did the model \"miss\" - e.g. did not recognize as entities which are entities according to the Gold Standard? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go on, it is important that you understand true/false positives/negatives as well as the evaluation metrics above. Take some time now to research the web in order to find answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question: How are the evaluation metrics above defined in the context of evaluating Machine Learning models? How do they relate to True/False Positives/Negatives above? Please provide an intuitive description as well as the mathmatical formula for each metric. \n",

    "##### Calculating Metrics based on token-level annotations or full entity-level. \n",
    "The concepts above are our first step toward understanding how to evaluate our model effectively. However, in NER, we need to take into account that we can calculate our metrics either based on all tokens (words) found in the document, or only on the entities found in the document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Token-Level evaluation. \n",
    "Token level evaluation evaluates how accurately did the model tag *each individual word/token* in the input. In order to understand this, we need to understand something called the \"BILUO\" Scheme (or BILOU or BIO). The spacy docs have a good reference. Please read and familiarize yourself with BILUO. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://spacy.io/api/annotation#biluo\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, we have not been working with the BILUO scheme, but with \"offsets\" (for example: (112,150,\"Email\") - which says there is an \"Email\" entity between positions 112 and 150 in the text). We would like to be able to evaluate our models on a token-level using BILUO - so we need to convert our data to BILUO. Fortunately, Spacy provides a helper method to do this for us.\n",
